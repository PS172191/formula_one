# This is a project for the school subject 'Talent Development'

### App explained
The app is an information app which shows multiple information about Formula 1. Think about the drivers, the teams, the season schedule etc. In the application, it uses the Ergast F1 API to showcase the information. Since that API is getting deprecated next year. I'm planning on making my own API, so that this app may continue to be funtionable.

## Getting Started
Install dependencies & packages
```bash
npm install 
```
Run the application:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

### *This app is still in development*
